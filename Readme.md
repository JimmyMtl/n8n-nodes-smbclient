# n8n-nodes-smbclient

This is a n8n community node that lets you interact with Samba/SMB2 file shares in your n8n workflows using
samba-client linux package. It enables
reading, writing, and managing files on SMB2-compatible network shares.

[N8N](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community
nodes documentation.

> Be sure to have the samba-client package installed in your n8n instance/container.
> For example, in a Dockerfile based on n8n image, you can add:
> ```Dockerfile
> RUN apk add --no-cache samba-client
> ```
> This ensures that the samba-client is installed before n8n starts.
>
> Without this package, the SMB node will not function correctly.
>
> Make sure to rebuild your Docker image or restart your container after making these changes.
> You can verify the installation by running `smbclient --version` inside your n8n container.
>
> If the command returns the version of samba-client, the installation was successful.
>
> If you encounter any issues, refer to the samba-client documentation or seek help from the n8n community forums.
>
> Remember to keep your samba-client package updated to ensure compatibility and security.
>
> For Alpine-based images, use `apk add --no-cache samba-client`.
>
> For Debian/Ubuntu-based images, use `apt-get update && apt-get install -y smbclient`.
>
> For CentOS-based images, use `yum install -y samba-client`.
>
> Adjust the package manager commands based on your specific Linux distribution used in your n8n instance.
>
> Ensure that the samba-client version is compatible with your SMB server version to avoid connectivity issues.

## Running local (Development)

> Required podman and n8nio image setup

1. Run build
2. Launch a terminal to your podman container
3. Go to nodes folder

>	    ports:
>	      - "5678:5678"
>	    volumes:
>	     - C:\_wksp\my-folder\n8n-nodes-smbclient:/opt/code-temp

6. Restart your pod and voil√†
